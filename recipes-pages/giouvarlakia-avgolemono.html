        <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into small squares</li>
        <li>1 small celery root, cut into small squares (300 g)</li>

        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>A little chopped dill</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </Ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the rice by putting it in a bowl and covering it with plenty of water.</li>
        <li>We let it soak until we prepare the rest of the ingredients, and before using it, we rinse it well and drain it.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, place the minced meat, egg, prepared rice, onion, carrot, olive oil, herbs, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Knead the ingredients very well until the minced meat changes color and turns white.</li>
        <li>We form small balls the size of a walnut and arrange them on a tray.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and cut all the vegetables into small, evenly sized squares with a knife.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and sauté the vegetables for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water and let it boil.</li>
        <li>We add all the yuvarlakia, salt and cover the food.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check the salt and pepper at the end of boiling.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to 1 and wait for the boiling to subside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, dissolve the lemon juice with the cornstarch.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the egg whites with a wire whisk until they form soft peaks.</li>
        <li>Add the yolks and continue beating.</li>
        <li>If you are going to reheat the food (always over very low heat), cornstarch is essential so that the egg and lemon mixture doesn't curdle .</li>
    </ol>
